/*
 * Random number and sequence generation via CBRNG.
 *
 * The Rand object uses the Threefry algorithm as the base RNG. This
 * configures it such that a single 64-bit seed value (either explicitly
 * specified, or derived from user-supplied data) gives a stream of 2^64
 * random numbers. It passes TestU01/BigCrush for both forward and
 * bit-reversed outputs.
 *
 * The important feature of Threefry is that it is fully seekable. This is
 * because it is fundamentally counter-based: instead of storing the output
 * of some sort of state-evolution function to prepare for computing the
 * next random output, it simply increments a counter every iteration. By
 * resetting this counter, random outputs can be arbitrarily replayed at
 * later times, without needing to compute intermediate values.
 *
 * Threefry outputs 4 64-bit random numbers each iteration. The implementation
 * in Random.cpp computes an arbitrary number of these iterations in
 * parallel, to take advantage of vectorization instructions in some CPUs.
 *
 * These outputs are buffered in rngbuf[] until they are needed. Further,
 * the buffer is never refilled until necessary. Data is kept in the buffer
 * in little-endian format. This is to keep output data (both bytes and
 * numbers) the same on differently-endian platforms, and to prioritize the
 * speed of rand_n() over, say, rand_u64(). It lets rand_n() fill large
 * amounts of space quickly, and doesn't penalize numeric generation overly
 * much, as most platforms can byte-swap during the copy into an integer.
 *
 * Public Rand seeking/seeding APIs:
 *
 *   Rand takes a 64-bit seed, or a series of 64-bit values which get
 *   condensed into a 64-bit seed. A seed must be supplied at construction,
 *   and can be changed later via the reseed() method.
 *
 *   For a given seed, the seek(N) method can update the state of the Rand
 *   object to be the same as it would be after N random numbers have been
 *   generated from the initial state. This is much faster than starting
 *   with the initial state and generating and discarding N numbers.
 *
 *   The getoffset() method will return a value N such that the N'th random
 *   number is about to be generated. In this way, the value of getoffset()
 *   can be saved before some amount of random number generation, and then
 *   restored via seek() in order to generate the same sequence of random
 *   numbers another time.
 *
 * Public Rand random number generation APIs:
 *
 *   rand_u64() returns the next random 64-bit integer in native endianness.
 *
 *   rand_range(max) returns a random value in the range [0, max). It is
 *   not completely bias-free, because that would require more than a
 *   single random u64, and it is important that it does to retain the
 *   seekability advantage of this RNG setup. The current bias is negligible.
 *
 *   rand_n(buf, len) fills buf[] with len random bytes. It strictly
 *   follows the sequence of random u64s that are generated, so that it is
 *   possible to seek the RNG "across" a call to rand_n(). It always uses
 *   some multiple of 8 bytes of data internally. Two consecutive calls to
 *   rand_n() are equivalent to one larger call if the first call has a
 *   length evenly divisible by 8. From a given starting state, rand_n()
 *   will emit the same byte byte sequence as the integers given by
 *   rand_u64() when those integers are considered in little-endian order.
 *
 * Public Rand random sequence APIs:
 *
 *   get_seq(seqtype, szelem) produces a RandSeq object, which has its own
 *   API for generating random sequences of items, or even individual items
 *   within those sequences. szelem has slightly different meanings,
 *   depending on the value of seqtype.
 *
 *   RandSeq objects can produce 4 different kinds of sequences:
 *     -) SEQ_DIST_1 will produce a sequence of szelem-byte objects, with
 *        unique values; each value differs from all others by at least 1 bit
 *     -) SEQ_DIST_2 will produce a sequence of szelem-byte objects, where
 *        each value differs from all other by at least 2 bits
 *     -) SEQ_DIST_3 will produce a sequence of szelem-byte objects, where
 *        each value differs from all other by at least 3 bits
 *     -) SEQ_NUM will produce a sequence of 64-bit integers, with values
 *        from 0 through szelem, inclusive.
 *
 *   A given RandSeq object represents only one sequence; it does not
 *   produce a different sequence of items if its APIs are called multiple
 *   times. If multiple sequences are needed, then multiple RandSeq objects
 *   can be created by repeatedly calling get_seq(). For seeking across
 *   get_seq() calls, each call to get_seq() will use 1 random number.
 *
 *   seq_maxelem() will return the maximum possible number of elements in
 *   the sequence type specified. This may be useful to allow a caller to
 *   fall back to a simpler/longer sequence type if their first choice does
 *   not contain as many elements as desired.
 *
 *   While SEQ_NUM and SEQ_DIST_1 have sequence lengths as probably
 *   expected, sequences with higher distance elements can be shorter than
 *   is intuitive. Sequences of elements with a minimum distance of 2
 *   (SEQ_DIST_2) are half the length of SEQ_DIST_1 (so, a sequence of
 *   1-byte elements of type SEQ_DIST_2 has a maximum sequence length of
 *   128, not 256). Sequences of elements with a minimum distance of 3
 *   (SEQ_DIST_3) are even shorter, as shown in the following table:
 *
 *       szelem  |  maxelem
 *      ---------------------
 *         1     |   2** 4  ==         16
 *         2     |   2**11  ==      2,048
 *         3     |   2**19  ==    524,288
 *         4     |   2**26  == 67,108,864
 *         5     |   2**34
 *         6     |   2**42
 *         7     |   2**50
 *         8     |   2**57
 *
 *   These higher-distance sequences can be useful for preventing
 *   collisions in tests which examine the effects of single-bit changes in
 *   hash inputs. With 2 bits of difference between elements, toggling any
 *   bit will never produce another element in the same sequence. This
 *   means that it will never be the case that one iteration of a test will
 *   account for the hash difference between (e.g.) key A and key B while
 *   another iteration will use the difference between key B and key
 *   A. There may be some overlap at the edges (e.g. if C and D are two
 *   elements in the sequence obtained from SEQ_DIST_2, then C^(1<<x) may
 *   equal D^(1<<y) for some x and y, but C^(1<<x) will never equal D.
 *
 *   Further, if 3 bits of difference are possible then that means that no
 *   items in the same test can overlap at all.
 *
 * Public RandSeq random sequence APIs:
 *
 *   write(buf, elem_lo, elem_n) fills buf[] with elem_n elements in its
 *   random sequence, starting with elem_lo. If write() is called with
 *   invalid values (e.g. a request for more elements than exist in the set
 *   specified in the RandSeq object), then it will return false, and no
 *   data will be written to buf[].
 *
 *   Due to details of the current implementation, sequences of elements
 *   larger than 8 bytes do not represent a true random sampling of those
 *   elements. For example, if 12-byte elements are needed for some
 *   SEQ_DIST_* type, then no two elements produced by RandSeq will ever
 *   match in their first 8 bytes. For now this should suffice, and it
 *   seems an acceptable tradeoff for not making this code even more
 *   complex than it is.
 *
 *   maxelem() returns the maximum number of elements that are in the
 *   random sequence, just as in Rand::seq_maxelem().
 */

/*
 * The only somewhat user-serviceable part here. This defines how many
 * copies of the RNG are run in parallel during bulk generation. A good
 * value here is the highest number of 64-bit integers that can fit in the
 * largest vector size your machine supports. For example, AVX2 supports
 * vectors with 4 64-bit integers, so 4 is a good value on AVX2 machines.
 *
 * This value ONLY affects performance. It does not alter any random values
 * that are returned from these objects.
