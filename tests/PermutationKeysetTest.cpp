    //----------

    // This computation exactly reflects the recursive key generation loop
    // above, except this has been unrolled into an iterative form. To
    // explain it, assume the possible blocks are numbered 0, 1, 2, etc., a
    // dot represents any possible block, and maxlen is 5.
    //
    // If all block combinations of the form "0...." have been processed,
    // that was counts[4] + 1 hashes. If n is at least that value, then it
    // refers to a key after all of those keys, so we subtract off that key
    // count; we now know that the key we're interested in can't start with
    // block 0, and we know how far away n was (in the key-generation
    // space) from the last key that starts with block 0. In this way, we
    // can keep peeling off counts[4] + 1 from n to determine the index of
    // the first block.
    //
    // The key of the form "1" is generated before any key of the form "1."
    // or "1...." (etc.). So the first key after "0...."  is "1". This is
    // why one key is subtracted from n before checking the next length
    // value (the "n--" at the top of the loop).
    //
    // From there, we "recurse"/iterate down to longer lengths, peeling off
    // indices to find the next first key index, and deciding to stop
    // recursing when n hits 0. When that happens, the complete list of
    // indices for the nth combination has been found, and the "recursion
    // depth" is the length of that list.
