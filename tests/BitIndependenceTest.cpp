//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// BIC test
//
// This test checks to see if hash output bits tend to change independently or not,
// depending on the input bits. For each possible combination of output bits, it
// hashes a random inputs, flips a single bit of the input, hashes that, and sees
// which bits changed. This is repeated a number of times, and is also repeated for
// each keybit. A new set of test keys is randomly generated for each (keybit, output
// bit 1, output bit 2) tuple. The test then looks for whichever of those tuples had
// the highest deviation from expected values.
//
// Note that these expected values are not necessarily exactly equal to the test
// count divided by 4. This is because some individual bits may, by chance and/or due
// to bias in the hash, not be split exactly evenly across 0 and 1 outputs. The
// chi-square test of independence handles this explicitly.
//
// To be efficient, this implementation counts each bit pair possibility in neat but
// confusing ways. Each (key bit, output bit A, output bit B) tuple needs, in some
// sense, 4 numbers. These numbers form a table which looks like:
//
//   -------------------------------------
//   | bit x   changed | bit x unchanged |
//   | bit y   changed | bit y   changed |
//   |      [11]       |      [01]       |
//   -------------------------------------
//   | bit x   changed | bit x unchanged |
//   | bit y unchanged | bit y unchanged |
//   |      [10]       |      [00]       |
//   -------------------------------------
//
// Instead of keeping 4 integers per tuple, this implementation only keeps 1: the
// value of the '[11]' box. But it also keeps track of one number per (key bit,
// output bit) tuple, which is how many times that bit changed for the given
// keybit. These 2 sets of numbers take up less space than the full table would,
// they are much cheaper to compute than the full table would be, and they can be
// used to reconstruct the values in each of those 4 boxes in the full table.
//
// The value of box [11] is the number of times bits x and y changed together.
// These values make up the andcount[] vector.
//
// The sum of boxes [11] and [01] is the number of times bit y changed.
// The sum of boxes [11] and [10] is the number of times bit x changed.
// These values make up the popcount[] vector.
//
// The sum of all the boxes is the number of tests, which is a known constant.
//
// The value in box [11] is andcount[x, y].
// The value in box [10] is therefore popcount[x] - andcount[x, y].
// The value in box [01] is therefore popcount[y] - andcount[x, y].
// The value in box [00] is therefore testcount - box[11] - box[10] - box[01].
//
// The technically-correct value for hashbitpairs is "hashbits / 2 * (hashbits - 1)",
// but the formulations currently used allow for space between rows of data in the
// andcount vector, which will allow for threads to separate themselves using the
// keybit index alone, since it won't ever share a cacheline with data from a
// different keybit.
